# Deep Learning Transformer Model for Natural Language Processing
The "Transformer Model for NLP" project focuses on implementing a Transformer model from scratch for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The primary objective is to train and evaluate the Transformer model using the Wiki-2-Text dataset, which consists of text documents sourced from Wikipedia.

## Project Overview
In this project, a Transformer model is developed to generate coherent and meaningful text based on the input data. The Transformer architecture, known for its effectiveness in NLP tasks, is leveraged to capture long-range dependencies and effectively model sequential data. The model is trained using the Wiki-2-Text dataset, enabling it to learn the statistical patterns and linguistic structures present in the text corpus.

## Project Components
The project comprises the following key components:

* Data Preparation: The Wiki-2-Text dataset is preprocessed and tokenized to create a training set for the Transformer model.

* Transformer Model: The Transformer model is designed and implemented from scratch. It consists of attention mechanisms, multi-head self-attention layers, feed-forward neural networks, and positional encodings. These components allow the model to effectively capture semantic and syntactic information from the input text.

* Training and Evaluation: The Transformer model is trained on the Wiki-2-Text dataset using appropriate optimization techniques, such as Adam optimization or stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The model is evaluated based on perplexity to assess its performance.

Transfer Learning: The trained Transformer model is applied to the PennTreeBank dataset to demonstrate transfer learning capabilities. By fine-tuning the model on a different dataset, the project showcases the ability of the Transformer model to generalize across diverse language tasks.
